Neon Dysplasia: Blood Orange is a standard, largely systems based, shmup game with an implied narrative about a Polybius-like-game created with the express goal of mass indoctrination into a avarice-positive mindset. The player, acting as the player of said ‘Polybius-like’ (how meta), may choose to shoot and kill enemies in every altercation or mostly if not completely peacefully allow the enemies to retreat. Non-violent options describe the journey of said in universe character fighting the psychoactive effects of the game and vice versa for the violent alternative. Mechanically, non-violence rewards the player with an ending and violence unlocks endless mode.
